# BO2-No-Box-Limits

This modification disables map specific and game specific weapon limits. \
There are a couple of versions I made so you can pick which one fits best.

## Installation
Compile one of the files as ```_zm_magicbox.gsc``` and place it in ```\t6r\data\maps\mp\zombies```.


## 1. double_weapons.gsc
Disables the check for already having a weapon that is in the box. \
This means you can get the Ray Gun out of the box when you already have it, doing so will refill its ammo. \
Having the PAP'ed version of a weapon counts as another weapon, so you can have the Ray Gun & the PAP'ed Ray Gun.

## 2. no_limits.gsc
Only disables weapon checks for wonder weapons, so everyone can have a Blundergat and it is not capped to 1 per game. \
This also means you can have a Ray Gun & Ray Gun MK2 at the same time.

## 3. double_weapons-no_limits.gsc
Combines the 2 tweaks listed above. (Recommended)

## 4. everything.gsc
Disables **all** box checks, this means non box weapons (such as some wall weapons) will be placed in the box. (Not recommended)
